A small, lightweight Employee management tool I created as a side project for school so I wouldn't have to do a lot more in the future and just study something else.

The application's interface is in Hungarian, and I added a few Hungarian comments as well for my teacher, but the code should be easy to understand by anyone, since I never use Hungarian variable names, the only things that are in my language as well would be the SQL statements, since this app requires a very specific table to be present.
